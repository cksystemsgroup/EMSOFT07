          ==========================================================

The Embedded Systems Week (ESWEEK) 2007 is the premier scientific
event in design and implementation of embedded systems hardware,
software and tools.  ESWEEK brings together three major conferences in
the embedded systems area, namely, CODES+ISSS, EMSOFT and CASES, as
well as other guest conferences, associated workshops, and tutorials.
ESWEEK is sponsored by the ACM and IEEE.

One registration, three conferences: registered attendees to either
CODES+ISSS, CASES, or EMSOFT will be allowed to attend sessions in the
other conference as well for free! (Guest conferences and associated
workshops may require separate registration.)

The three conferences (CODES+ISSS, EMSOFT, CASES) have independent
technical committees and technical programs, as well as separate paper
submissions and review processes. Authors are encouraged to choose where
they want to submit their papers based on the topic of the paper and
suitability to each conference. PLEASE SEE BELOW for topic information
for each conference!

Proposals for special sessions and panels are also invited. These should
be sent to the program chairs of each conference, and should succinctly
outline the topic, positioning and likely participants.

CODES+ISSS is the annual International Conference on
Hardware-Software Codesign and System Synthesis. The conference
proudly continues the tradition of being a high-quality forum for
active discussion on current and innovative topics. The program will
bring together the latest in academic and industrial research and
development. High-quality original papers will be accepted for oral
presentation followed by interactive poster sessions. Selected papers
from the conference proceedings will be targeted for journal
publication.

Papers should represent original work, not published or submitted for
publication in other forums. Formal proceedings will be published
in hardcopy, CD-ROM and web page forms (copyright by ACM and IEEE).
A blind review process will be enforced, thus AUTHORS SHOULD NOT
REVEAL AUTHORSHIP DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY THROUGH REFERENCES. Papers
must be in PDF format and should not exceed 6 pages in ACM two-column
format (9pt on 8.5"x11" letter size paper).  For formatting
instructions and templates, visit
www.acm.org/sigs/pubs/proceed/template.html.

E M S O F T  2007 (www.emsoft.org)
==================================

EMSOFT is the annual International Conference on Embedded Software.
The purpose of the conference is to bring together researchers and
developers from academia, industry, and government to advance the
science, engineering, and technology in embedded software development.
EMSOFT was started in 2001. The previous conferences were held in Lake
Tahoe, USA (2001), Grenoble, France (2002), Philadelphia, USA (2003),
Pisa, Italy (2004), Jersey City, USA (2005), and Seoul, South Korea
(2006).

C A S E S  2007 (www.casesconference.org)
=========================================

The CASES conference provides a forum for emerging technology in
embedded computing systems, with an emphasis on compilers and
architectures for embedded systems. CASES is a common forum for
researchers with an interest in embedded systems to reach across
vertically integrated communities and to promote synergies. As evident
from the past CASES meetings, several emerging applications are
critically dependent on these interactions for their sustained growth
and evolution.
